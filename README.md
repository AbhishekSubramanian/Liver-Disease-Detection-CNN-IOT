# Liver-Disease-Detection-CNN-IOT

Liver diseases are increasingly common and present a significant challenge for detection. These conditions, often exacerbated by excessive alcohol consumption or other underlying health issues, impact a considerable portion of the population. 
This project leverages the core principles of Image Processing and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the detection of liver health. 

The approach utilizes CNN to analyze Computed Tomography (CT) images of the liver, enabling the differentiation between healthy and unhealthy livers. The project encompasses the successful extraction of image features using image processing techniques, followed by the extraction of critical information at various layers of the CNN algorithm. 

Additionally, the project integrates an Internet of Things (IoT) system, comprising of both a Wi-Fi module and a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) module. The Wi-Fi module continuously updates the liver status of a patient to a server. In cases where an unhealthy liver is detected, the GSM module is designed to automatically send an alert message to the patientâ€™s emergency contact. This dual-module setup ensures timely updates and critical alerts, enhancing the potential for prompt medical intervention.
